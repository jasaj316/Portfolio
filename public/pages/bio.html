  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h3>A short biography</h3>
</div>
<article class="about">
  <p>Born and raised in Muskoka, ON., I developed an appreciation of nature by living in such a beautiful region.</p>
  <p>I obtained an advanced diploma with Honours in 'Game Development' at Durham College,
    as well as a diploma with Honours in 'Interactive Media Design-Web' at Georgian College.
  </p>
  <p>
    After graduating from Durham College, I accepted a Texture Artist position at Guru Studio in Toronto,
    where I was privileged to contribute to the television series 'Paw Patrol'.
    Working within a large team allowed me to hone my communication skills
    in order to successfully collaborate, troubleshoot, and share solutions amongst team members and managers.
    Production deadlines were often very tight, which required me to adapt my workflow, limiting the amount of time
    spent on individual tasks, in order to complete assignments on schedule.

  <p> My other passions (in no particular order) include:
    <br /><br />
    - Cooking<br />
    - Spicy food<br />
    - Composing electronic music (as heard in my Demo Reel)<br />
    - Cross-country road trips<br />
    - Cats<br />
    - Astronomy<br />
    - Apprends le fran√ßais

  <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my biography. I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
