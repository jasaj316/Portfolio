  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h3>A short biography</h3>
</div>
<article class="about">
  <p>Born and raised in Muskoka, ON., I developed an appreciation of nature by living there.</p>
  <p>I obtained an advanced diploma in 'Game Development' at Durham College,
    as well as a diploma in 'Interactive Media Design-Web' at Georgian College, having achieved honors in both
    courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    After graduating from Durham College, I was hired by Guru Studio in Toronto to produce textures and materials for
    the show 'Paw Patrol'.
    This taught me a lot about communication between team members, collaboration, troubleshooting, and the sharing of
    ideas. Production deadlines were very tight, and I had to learn to adapt my workflow to limit the amount of time
    spent on individual tasks in order to complete assignments on schedule.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've since learned Web Development in Georgian College, and now seek to return to employment in the 3D Art field.
    It's much more rewarding to me to recreate or mimic real-world objects than web pages.
  </p>

  <p> My other passions (in no particular order) include:
    <br><br>
    - Cooking<br>
    - Making electronic music<br>
    - Road trips<br>
    - Typography<br>
    - Casually playing MMOs<br>
    - Spicy food<br>
    - Biology

  <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my biography.</p>
